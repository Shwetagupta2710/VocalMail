# VocalMail

## A Voice-based Email System for the Visually Challenged

### ABSTRACT
Email is a crucial medium for communication worldwide, allowing the exchange of confidential and time-sensitive information. However, the visually impaired community, comprising approximately 253 million individuals globally, encounters significant barriers in using traditional email systems. With advancing technology, these individuals often feel left out and face challenges in communication.

To address this, we introduce **VocalMail**, a web-based application designed specifically for visually impaired users. By leveraging **Interactive Voice Response (IVR)** technology, VocalMail enables users to control their email accounts using voice commands, allowing them to read, send, and manage their emails efficiently without relying on traditional graphical user interfaces.
